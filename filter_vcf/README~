This folder contains scripts to produce randomly phased VCF files from
VCF files with only one variant column.

1) Run the program random_phasing.py as

./random_phasing.py my_file.vcf

or with a wildcard

./random_phasing.py *.vcf

2) This folder also includes a program to extract just indels from a
VCF file. One way to run it on the randomly phased VCF files is as
follows. 

./indels_filter.py *-rand.vcf
