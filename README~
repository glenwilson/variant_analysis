VCF files were modified to list variants in one column. See folder
variants-onecol/

ALL VCF files are now in the folder VCFs.
The endings mean the following:
-indels.vcf file has only indels

-beagle file was phased by beagle
-np file was not phased
-rand file was randomly phased

-qual file has low quality variants filtered out (<800 quality removed)

Go to following folders to run analyses
indels-maxmin/
indels-bottleneck/

Deprecated folders (now hidden with initial '.'):
indels-phased/
indels/
indels1/
find-primers/

The folder find-primers/ was the initial attempt at making windows
which allow for primers at start and stop. This has been improved
and refined to the folder indels-bottleneck/.
