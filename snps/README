See the folder indels-bottleneck for steps 1--4. We take the windows
produced there to start our analysis of SNPS.


5) Now calculate the number of distinct SNPS of each pair in a given
window windows_with_primers.csv where the variants are given as
command line arguments.

run: nblrr_snps_windows.py
command line args: vcf files for variants, so *all.passonecol.vcf
input: windows_with_primers.csv
output: windows_with_primers-snps.csv

6) Now order windows

run: matrix_order_good_windows.py
input: windows_with_primers-snps.csv
output: matrix_order_nblrr_primers-snps.csv 


###
# The following should be done in the folder indels-bottleneck
###

This folder contains commands to produce input files for the 
primer3_core program and commands to identify good regions to 
use for PCR with highly variable length.

1) get_conserved_windows.py 
This takes ordered nblrr data in csv format as input, extracts some number of
good nblrr genes, and produces a new csv file which gives windows of conserved
regions in the nblrr gene. Each row is a nblrr gene, and the entries in the row
are tuples (start, len) with the start position of the conserved region and the
length of the conserved region. 

command line args: phased vcf files with SNPs and INDELs
*all.passonecol.vcf

input: nblrr-noscaffold-windows.csv
output: conserved_regions-nblrr.csv

2) This will open up conserved_regions-nblrr.csv and produce a csv of
windows to be analyzed.

run: make_new_windows.py
input: conserved_regions-nblrr.csv
output: primer3-windows.csv

3) make_primer3_files.py 
input: primer3-windows.csv
input: Spolyrhiza9509_20150416.fasta
output: primer3-files.txt

3.5) run primer3_core on the output of previous command

primer3_core primer3-files.txt > primer3-files.out

input: primer3-files.txt
output: primer3-files.out

4) turn primer3 output into windows 

run: primer3out_to_windows.py

input: primer3-files.out
output: windows_with_primers.csv
