VCF files were modified to list variants in one column.
Use the script make_one_var_col.py to accomplish this.
Documentation of its use is given in the script itself. 

ALL VCF files are now in the folder VCFs.
The endings mean the following:
-indels.vcf file has only indels
-beagle file was phased by beagle
-np file was not phased
-rand file was randomly phased
-qual file has low quality variants filtered out (<800 quality removed)

Go to the following folders to run analyses
indels-maxmin/
indels-bottleneck/
